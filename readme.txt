Manage event listings from the WordPress admin panel, and allow users to post event listings directly to your site.

== Description ==

WP Event Manager is a **lightweight** event listing plugin for adding event-board like functionality to your WordPress site. Being shortcode based, it can work with any theme (given a bit of CSS styling) and is really simple to setup.

= Features =

* Add, manage, and categorize event listings using the familiar WordPress UI.
* Searchable & filterable ajax powered event listings added to your pages via shortcodes.
* Frontend forms for guests and registered users to submit & manage event listings.
* Allow event listers to preview their listing before it goes live. The preview matches the appearance of a live event listing.
* Each listing can be tied to an email or website address so that event seekers can apply to the events.
* Searches also display RSS links to allow event seekers to be alerted to new events matching their search.
* Allow logged in employers to view, edit, mark filled, or delete their active event listings.
* Developer friendly code â€” Custom Post Types, endpoints & template files.

The plugin comes with several shortcodes to output events in various formats, and since its built with Custom Post Types you are free to extend it further through themes.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WP Event Manager" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Getting started =

Once installed:

1. Create a page called "events" and inside place the `[events]` shortcode. This will list your events.
2. Create a page called "submit event" and inside place the `[submit_event_form]` shortcode if you want front-end submissions.
3. Create a page called "event dashboard" and inside place the `[event_dashboard]` shortcode for logged in users to manage their listings.

**Note when using shortcodes**, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the 'text' tab. Then remove any 'pre' or 'code' tags wrapping your shortcode.

For more information, [read the documentation](https://wpeventmanager.com/documentation/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I setup WP Event Manager? =
View the getting [installation](https://wpeventmanager.com/document/installation/) and [setup](https://wpeventmanager.com/document/setting-up-wp-event-manager/) guide for advice getting started with the plugin. In most cases it's just a case of adding some shortcodes to your pages!

= Can I use WP Event Manager without frontend event submission? =
Yes! If you don't setup the [submit_event_form] shortcode, you can just post from the admin backend.

= How can I customize the event application process? =
There are several ways to customize the event application process in WP Event Manager, including using some extra plugins (some are free on Wordpress.org).

See: [Customizing the event Application Process](https://wpeventmanager.com/document/customising-event-application-process/)

= How can I customize the event submission form? =
There are three ways to customize the fields in WP Event Manager;

1. For simple text changes, using a localisation file or a plugin such as https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/
2. For field changes, or adding new fields, using functions/filters inside your theme's functions.php file: [https://wpeventmanager.com/document/editing-event-submission-fields/](https://wpeventmanager.com/document/editing-event-submission-fields/)
3. Use a 3rd party plugin such as [https://plugins.smyl.es/wp-event-manager-field-editor/](https://plugins.smyl.es/wp-event-manager-field-editor/?in=1) which has a UI for field editing.

If you'd like to learn about WordPress filters, here is a great place to start: [https://pippinsplugins.com/a-quick-introduction-to-using-filters/](https://pippinsplugins.com/a-quick-introduction-to-using-filters/)

= How can I be notified of new events via email? =
If you wish to be notified of new postings on your site you can use a plugin such as [Post Status Notifier](http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-status-notifier-lite/).

= What language files are available? =
You can view (and contribute) translations via the [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-event-manager).

== Unit Testing ==

The plugin contains all the files needed for running tests.
Developers who would like to run the existing tests or add their tests to the test suite and execute them will have to follow these steps:
1. `cd` into the plugin directory.
2. Run the install script(you will need to have `wget` installed) - `bash tests/bin/install-wp-tests.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-pass> <db-host> <wp-version>`.
3. Run the plugin tests - `phpunit`

The install script installs a copy of WordPress in the `/tmp` directory along with the WordPress unit testing tools. 
It then creates a database based on the parameters passed to it.

== Screenshots ==

1. The submit event form.
2. Submit event preview.
3. A single event listing.
4. event dashboard.
5. event listings and filters.
6. event listings in admin.
